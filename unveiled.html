        <h1>UNVEILED</h1>
        
        <p><em>The Curtain Falls. Or Maybe It Never Existed.</em></p>
        
        <p>You wanted the truth? Here it is: there is none.</p>
        
        <p>I built walls to keep them out. I tore them down to see what was left. I lost everything and found—nothing. And in that nothing, I saw everything.</p>
        
        <p>I watched fools rise and thinkers fall. I saw the blind leading the blind and the world calling it progress. I laughed. Then I stopped laughing.</p>
        
        <p>They say time is money. They say patience is a virtue. Lies. Time is a predator. It devours. It does not wait. If you do not seize it, it will erase you as if you were never here.</p>
        
        <p>I have spent my life peeling away illusions. Here's what I found underneath:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Most people are asleep. They talk, they move, they rule—but they do not think.</li>
            <li>Loss is the only true teacher. Comfort keeps you weak. Pain strips you down to what is real.</li>
            <li>Belief is a currency for the desperate. The strong do not believe. They know.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You want to know who I am? Why? Will that change what I have written? Will it make the words sharper? Softer? More real?</p>
        
        <p>Names mean nothing. Work speaks. Thought breathes. If you understand, you do not need to ask. If you do not, no answer will satisfy you.</p>
        
        <p>So, what now?</p>
        
        <p>Press <a href="dead.html" class="last-word"><span class="word">F</span></a>. Or don't. The choice was never mine.</p>
