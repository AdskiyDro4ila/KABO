        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        
        <p><em>What is a name but a shadow?</em></p>
        
        <p>If you are here to collect facts, to pin down a life as if it were an insect under glass, you have already taken the wrong path. No person is a fixed point in time. No work is a single, finished thought.</p>
        
        <p>What matters is not where I have been, nor what titles I have carried, but the force of what I create. Thought, if it is to matter, must crack foundations. It must burn away illusion and demand more of the one who encounters it.</p>
        
        <p>This space is not a monument. It is a provocation.</p>
        
        <h2>What drives this work?</h2>
        
        <p>Some build for stability. Others build for power. I build to unsettle. To cast doubt on the inherited truths we carry like rusted chains. If an idea does not shake something in you, does not force you to look again, then it was never truly alive.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Creation is destruction—nothing new is built without first breaking ground.</li>
            <li>Meaning is not given—it must be seized, shaped, and fought for.</li>
            <li>Comfort is the enemy—what soothes the mind, dulls it. What challenges, awakens.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
        
        <p>Because we are all, at some level, seeking. And not all paths should lead back to what is known.</p>
        
        <p>Some roads must disappear into the dark.</p>
        
        <p>Some words must demand more from those who read them.</p>
        
        <p>This is for those who refuse to settle for the surface.</p>
        
        <p>If that is you, then read on.</p>
