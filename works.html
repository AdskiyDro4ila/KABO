        <h1>MY WORKS</h1>
        
        <p><em>What is a work, but a question left unanswered?</em></p>
        
        <p>To create is not to offer solutions. It is to set fire to what was assumed, to leave behind traces of something that refuses to settle.</p>
        
        <p>What you will find here are not products. Not conclusions. Not neat, finished things to be consumed and forgotten.</p>
        
        <p>These are fractures in the familiar. Open doors that do not promise to lead anywhere safe.</p>
        
        <h2>What has been built?</h2>
        
        <p>Call them books, writings, thoughts—call them nothing at all. What matters is not what they are, but what they do to you.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Some will pull you into the abyss, where meaning dissolves, and only your own strength will bring you back.</li>
            <li>Some will whisper of things you always suspected but never dared to name.</li>
            <li>Some will demand to be rejected, for only through resistance does real thought emerge.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>What they share is this: they were never meant to comfort. They were never meant to be easy.</p>
        
        <h2>How should one approach them?</h2>
        
        <p>Not as a follower, not as a collector, but as one who is willing to wrestle. To read is to risk. To understand is to let something change you.</p>
        
        <p>If you seek entertainment, look elsewhere. If you seek a mirror, enter.</p>
